# Animal-Database
Animal Database is an Electron based application that holds multiple animal entries where a user can learn facts about a specific animal. The application is designed so that the user is able to enter in new animals into the application to grow the database of animals. There are multiple pages of the application:
-Home: the landing page of the application
-Stats: this page shows different stats like the population of the database, a geographic map displaying the number of animal in that region based on the total entries in the database, and three pie charts displaying a representation of the database based on the different categories (Diet, Class, Status)
- Add: this page allows the user to add a new animal entry to the database by entering in the different data required
- Remove: allows the user to remove an animal entry from the database
- Edit: allows the user to make changes to an animal entry (accessed through an animal's page)
- Search: allows the user to search through the database via two methods (by name or by continent)
- Display: displays the total list of animals that are in the database
